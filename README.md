This is my entry for the [44th Ludum Dare game jam](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/obsessed). I had lot's of fun making it and really enjoyed the challenge.

## The Game
The theme of the game jam was "Your life is currency". I decided to create a game inspired by Geometry Dash and implement new features and elements to do with the theme.
The goal of the game is to reach the end of the level whilst collecting as many coins as possible and avoiding the spikes that will damage the player.

#### Features:
* Collision detection using raycasts
* Time rewind
* Color change over time
* Visual and audio effects

## The Process
#### Day 1:
* Came up with the basic idea and layout
* Decided I wanted to add the color-change feature so implemented that
* Started adding player movement

#### Day 2:
* Finished the player movement
* Added health management and a bar that displays it
* Added spikes and damage control
* Added the player rewind feature that allows the player to go back in time

#### Day 3:
* Finished implementing collision detection
* Added the player death & player success
* Added the menu and end scene
* Added pause feature and level management
* Added score management and display (with high score)
* Added SFX and music that persists throughout the scenes
* Added particles to make the game feel more alive
* Finished the game

## The Experience:
It was a great experience for me. It allowed me to practice everything I had learned, and experiment with new features. This is my first full game and has more scripts that any of games in the past.
The game jam was a great opportunity to take part is such a fun challenge. I acknowledge the fact that the game is still pretty simple but I'm definitely progressing and aiming for a bigger game might have been restraining for me.

I decided to make a polished version of the game with a few improvements to the collision detection, the rewind user-experience and to the level.

I look forward to participating in my second game jam soon and hopefully doing something completely different!
